# native-base-cli
A basic cli that generates a simple 3 page application with [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native),
[native-base](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase) and [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation).

## Installation:

```
$ npm install -g native-base-cli
$ native-base init
```
## Note:

Make sure your ssh is added to your github account as this clones the boilerplate repo to your system.

* Add expo support.
* Add TabNavigator example.
